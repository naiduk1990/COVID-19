This project shows the affect of coronavirus worldwide geographically.
In India more than 23,000 people affected by this Virus.
In this project the Dataset used for globally is COVID-19. Here there are so many visualization and comparision of effects of different countries.

By seeing all this visualization with different packages, I want to conclude Plotly is more sophiisticated data visualization tool and this is better suited for creating elobraate plots more efficiently
